    <h3>THE INTERNET: 90s VS 2022</h3>
     <p>The internet has changed so much since the 90s. I remember going to the libaray to go onto my myspace account.I remember using my yahoo.com or hotmail.com. The 90s internet was dial-up with its screeching and beeping. Today we have Google, wifi and the ability to work and live anywhere in the world. What I have learn thurs far is that computers are very dumb. The first step to work a computer is you need the user to tell it to do something.Learning the basic funtions in 2022 is more important than ever before. 2022 we will be introduced to the MetaVerse. The Metaverse technologies that make up the metaverse can include virtual reality—characterized by persistent virtual worlds that continue to exist even when you're not playing—as well as augmented reality that combines aspects of the digital and physical worlds. However, it doesn't require that those spaces be exclusively accessed via VR or AR. A virtual world, like aspects of Fortnite that can be accessed through PCs, game consoles, and even phones, according to an article posted by Wired.com. Whatever that becomes of the Metaverse we will always need to know the basic Fundamentals of computers to continue to create the code and software for this new technology.</p>
